# Microsoft Incomming Webhooks
This package helps you making requests to Microsoft Teams Incomming Webhooks. Use it in your application to send a notification to a channel.

## Installation

```shell
$ npm install ms-teams-webhook
```

## Usage

### Initialize the webhook

The package exports a `IncomingWebhook` class. You'll need to initialize it with the URL you received from Microsoft Teams.

The URL can come from installation the `Webhook Connector` by `right click on a channel > Incomming Webhook > Configuration > (insert a name) > Create`


```javascript
const { IncomingWebhook } = require('ms-teams-webhook');

// Read a url from the environment variables
const url = process.env.MS_TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL;

// Initialize
const webhook = new IncomingWebhook(url);
```

### Send a webhook

This is a very nice page to generate the payload for your Microsoft Teams Webhook.

You can send only JSON stringify strings. `JSON.stringify({paylod})`

```javascript
const { IncomingWebhook } = require('ms-teams-webhook');

// Read a url from the environment variables
const url = process.env.MS_TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL;

// Initialize
const webhook = new IncomingWebhook(url);

(async () => {
  await webhook.send(JSON.stringify({
	"@type": "MessageCard",
	"@context": "https://schema.org/extensions",
	"summary": "Issue 176715375",
	"themeColor": "0078D7",
	"title": "Issue opened: \"Push notifications not working\"",
	"sections": [
		{
			"activityTitle": "Miguel Garcie",
			"activitySubtitle": "9/13/2016, 11:46am",
			"activityImage": "https://connectorsdemo.azurewebsites.net/images/MSC12_Oscar_002.jpg",

			"text": "There is a problem with Push notifications, they don't seem to be picked up by the connector."
		}
	]
})
  );
})();

```
